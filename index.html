    Make a directory =mkdir
    Change the directory = cd “name of the directory”
    Create a file = touch “file name”
    To see git changes = git states
    Going to root in terminal =wmic
    Terminal help =/?
    Show the folders = ls
    Show the git folders also =ls-a
    
    
    // Taking and edit and  pushing a file to github =  github repo=>clone=>changes=>add=>comment=>push
    
    Taking files from git repositories = git   clone //“ repositories link ex https://github.com/BNsrujan“
    git add .   = “it will add all the  untracked file or fill which we have created files git“
    git add “location of the file” =“it will add the specific file”
    git commit -m “ ”comment on what you have changed” ” 
    git push origin “branch name ex:main , master”  =push the code
    
    //pushing a new folder to the new repositories in github
    git init = used to create a new git repositories in folder
    git remote add origin “github repository link”
    git remote -v = to verify liked or not
    git push origin “branch name”
    git push -u origin main = -u”upstream(shortcut)for origin main”
    
    //branch commands
    
    git checkout -b “new branch name” = adding a new branch
    git branch = to chick branch
    git branch -M “new name ex: main” = to rename current branch
    git checkout “branch name” = to shift from one branch to another 
    git branch -d “branch name” = to delete branch
     
    
    //merging branch codes
    git diff = “branch name which we have to compare with” = to compare commits,branches,files and more 
    q to exit the git diff
    git merge   =“add the branch name which we want to compare with the current one” 
    Resolving Merge Conflicts
    An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code
    between two commits.
    
    
    
    Pull request = it lest you tell others about changes  you are pushed to a repository in github
    git pull origin main =used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo
    to match that content.
    git remote= add upstream git://github.com/some-url
    git fetch =upstream
    git rebase =upstream/master
    
    
    
    Undoing Changes
    Case 1: staged changes not commited
    git reset “file name”
    git reset
    
    Case 2: commited changes (for one commit)
    git reset HEAD~1 =  (HEAD~1) =>latest edit
    git log = for checking the last edit
    q to exit the git log
    git reset
    
    Case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
    git reset “commit hash “  = for resting for specific edit
